==================

Rewrite of the factorization mods Router for Minecraft Forge (mc 1.5 v2)

This mod is only intended to be used by Docket servers.
If you like this mod, please feel free to download, compile and run it yourselves.

What does this mod do?
----------------------

The idea that started this mod was that the MCForge factorization Router for mc 1.5.2
behaved unexpectedly for us. Therefore we decided to create a new router which we call
the propagator.

The idea of it is to make it work, and sort the items in another way that the router, but
it will still server the same purpose in the long run.

Still it is kind of buggy, so please do not expect anything else.

_Warning!_ Right now this mod might duplicate or even worse void your items, so do not use
in production just yet.
